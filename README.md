Random Number Guesser

This tool is an interactive GUI-based game that challenges users to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The user provides a minimum and maximum value for the range, and the game generates a random number within that range. The user then attempts to guess the number, with the game providing hints to guide them.

Requirements
* Python 3.11.4
* tkinter library (usually included with Python)
* random library (also included with Python)

How to Use the Tool
* Run the Python script: You can run the script in any Python environment or IDE of your choice (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code, IDLE, etc.).
* Enter the range: Provide the minimum and maximum values for the range in which the random number will be generated.
* Guess the number: After the random number is generated, enter your guess in the provided text box.
* Receive hints: Based on your guess, the tool will give you hints indicating whether your guess is too high or too low.
* Keep guessing: Continue guessing until you find the correct number.

Example Use Case
If you input 1 as the minimum and 100 as the maximum range, the game will randomly select a number between 1 and 100. You will then try to guess this number, and the game will provide hints to help you reach the correct answer.

Have fun testing your guessing skills and challenging yourself to find the correct number!
